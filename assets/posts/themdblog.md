# What is the mdblog?

The idea was simple, create a blog that uses markdown files as 
it's source for posts using nothing but javascript and html.

The culmination of that idea became this blog, which is modular in that it loads the sidebar, header, footer etc
 using javascript allowing things to be edited easily. Further posts are loaded in a way that I can 
simply use my pycharm IDE to edit my blog and see the post previewed in real time.

Since everything is loaded with javascript I have a site map and manually downloadable rss feed which gives you some of the
basic features you're used to in a traditional blog platform.

Essentially I just wanted something simple that would let me use github to create posts.
I think this does the job nicely.
